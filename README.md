![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)
## Description
This is my portfolio that I recreated using React. It includes and about me section, a preview of some of my projects and a contact me section that links you to my github, linkedin and email. I used tailwind for the front end structure and also used the npm package react-social-icons for the icons on the navbar.
